# 🎬 SQL Project on Netflix Data

This project showcases various SQL queries used to analyze a Netflix dataset containing information about titles, genres, IMDb scores, cast, directors, and more. It covers essential data analysis tasks like aggregations, filtering, joining, and subqueries — perfect for beginners or intermediate users looking to strengthen their SQL skills with real data.

## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze content trends by type, genre, and year.
- Extract insights about IMDb scores and cast information.
- Practice SQL joins, aggregate functions, filters, and window queries.

## 📁 Dataset Structure

The database contains two primary tables:

- **`titles`**: Includes details about movies and TV shows such as `title`, `type`, `genre`, `release_year`, `imdb_score`, and `duration`.
- **`credits`**: Contains names of actors and directors (`name`) associated with titles and their `role` (Actor/Director).

## 🔍 Key Queries Performed

1. **Total number of titles**  
2. **Top 10 movies by IMDb score**  
3. **Titles released in a specific year (e.g., 2020)**  
4. **Count of titles by genre**  
5. **Average IMDb score by genre**  
6. **Longest movie by duration**  
7. **Count of titles by type (Movies vs TV Shows)**  
8. **Titles with the highest number of cast members**  
9. **Titles featuring a specific actor (e.g., Robert Downey Jr.)**  
10. **Number of titles directed by each director**  
11. **List of actors in a specific movie (e.g., Inception)**  
12. **Average IMDb score by release year**  
13. **Number of movies released each year**  
14. **Titles with more than a certain number of cast members**  
15. **Movies directed by a specific director (e.g., Christopher Nolan)**

## 🛠️ SQL Features Used

- `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `HAVING`, `WHERE`, `LIMIT`  
- Aggregate functions: `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`  
- Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (`WITH`)  
- Filtering using specific roles like `Actor` and `Director`

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Import the dataset into a SQL-compatible database (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQLite).
2. Run the queries provided in the `.sql` file.
3. Modify actor/director names or year values as needed for custom analysis.
